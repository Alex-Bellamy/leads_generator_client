To ensure that the panels are working at their best they should not be obstructed after installation. Solar panels work horses, with a long working life - in excess 40 years and most often come with a 25 year guarantee, pretty impressive!"

They require lots of space and are they are not suitable for every roof(our specialists will of course point this out if the case!). They are pricy to install and not cheap to move if you do. Whilst the return on investment (ROI) is one of the best you can make, its over a relatively long period. Efficiency is affected by the weather (although daylight is enough for them to work just not at their best). Production of the panels can also create pollution"
